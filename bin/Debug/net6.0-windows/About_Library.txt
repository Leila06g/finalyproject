A library is a place where books and
 sources of information are stored. 
They make it easier for people to get 
access to them for various purposes. 
Libraries are very helpful and economical 
too. They include books, magazines, newspapers,
 DVDs, manuscripts and more. In other words, they
 are an all-encompassing source of information.
A public library is open to everyone for fulfilling
 the need for information. They are run by the
 government, schools, colleges, and universities

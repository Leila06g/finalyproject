Every night Peter visits the Darling family 
house and listens to Mrs. Darling tell 
bedtime stories. He sits on the window listening.
 One evening, they see Peter trying to escape. 
As he tries to run away, he loses his shadow.
 He goes back to get his shadow. He wakes up
 the daughter of the house, Wendy Darling.
 Wendy helps him attach his shadow to his 
body again. Wendy tells him she knows a lot of
 bedtime stories too.
Peter invites Wendy to return to Neverland with him.
 He wants her to be the mother of the Lost Boys. 
Wendy agrees to the mission and asks for her brothers
 Michael and John to join them.
